# Vaultwarden Deployment with Cloudflare Tunnel

**BLUF**: This repository contains scripts and configurations for deploying a self-hosted Vaultwarden instance with Cloudflare Tunnel integration and DuckDNS custom subdomain via Docker Compose.

[Vaultwarden](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server) is an alternative implementation of the **Bitwarden** server API, written in Rust, and compatible with [upstream Bitwarden clients⁠](https://bitwarden.com/download/).

Bitwarden/Vaultwarden is capable of both [password management](https://bitwarden.com/help/password-manager-overview/) (via web app, desktop app, browser extension, mobile app, or CLI) and [secrets management](https://bitwarden.com/help/secrets-manager-overview/) (via web app, CLI, or SDK).

[DuckDNS](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/duckdns) is ... (Claude AI, please provide a write-up for DuckDNS as a service and replace this line... Thanks!)

If you have a registered domain, you can further customize your Bitwarden experience by modifying the server URLs (instructions provided further down).

<br>

## Prerequisites

- Linux/macOS server (or WSL instance if running Windows)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed
- [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- [DuckDNS account](https://www.duckdns.org/) + registered subdomain and token \<OR\> personal registered domain (leverage Cloudflare DNS if this option is chosen)
- Basic understanding of networking and Docker concepts

<br>

## Components

1. **Docker Compose Setup**: Deploys Vaultwarden and Cloudflare Tunnel containers
2. **DuckDNS subdomain**: Allows for secure access to your vault instance without relying on an IP address
3. **Cloudflare Tunnel**: Provides secure access without exposing ports
4. **Admin Token Generation**: Securely creates admin dashboard access

<br>

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Initial Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dynamic-stall/vaultwarden-docker
cd vaultwarden-docker
```

2. Create `.env` from `example` file (_be sure to add your personalized variables_):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required environment variables:
- `ADMIN_TOKEN`: Generated by `admin-token-create.sh`
- `VAULT_NAME`: Vaultwarden container and hostname (used to create `VAULT_DOMAIN` and `DOMAIN_ORIGIN`)
- `VAULT_DOMAIN`: Your domain (e.g., `vault.example.ddns.com`)
- `VAULT_PORT`: Local port for Vaultwarden (default: 8443)
- `TUNNEL_TOKEN`: Cloudflare Tunnel token (obtained from your personal Cloudflare account)
- `DDNS_DOMAIN`: Your DuckDNS subdomain (e.g., `example.ddns.com`; used to create `VAULT_DOMAIN` and `DOMAIN_ORIGIN`)
- `DDNS_TOKEN`: DuckDNS subdomain token (obtained from your personal DuckDNS account)
- `SMTP_*`: Email configuration variables

### 2. Cloudflare Tunnel Setup

1. Log into [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) dashboard

2. Navigate to **Access** → **Tunnels**

3. Create new tunnel:
   - Click _"Create a tunnel"_
   - Name your tunnel
   - Copy the token for `TUNNEL_TOKEN` in `.env`

4. Configure public hostname:
   - **Type**: HTTP
   - **URL**: http://localhost:8443
   - **Domain**: Your chosen subdomain (e.g., vault.example.com)

### 3. DuckDNS Setup

#### Option 1: Using DuckDNS (Free Domain)

1. Visit [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) and sign in using your preferred OAuth provider
2. Create a subdomain (e.g., _vault.duckdns.org_)
3. Copy your token from the DuckDNS dashboard
4. Add these variables to your `.env` file:
```bash
DDNS_DOMAIN=<your-chosen-subdomain>
DDNS_TOKEN=<your-duckdns-token>
```
* **NOTE** If you own `example.duckdns.org`, then set `DDNS_DOMAIN=example`.

The DuckDNS container will automatically:
- Update your IP address every 5 minutes
- Maintain your subdomain registration
- Handle logging and retry logic
- Keep your subdomain active (domains remain valid as long as they're updated once every 30 days)

No additional maintenance is required as long as the container remains running.

#### Option 2: Using Your Own Domain

If you have a registered domain, you can skip the DuckDNS setup and modify the `bw-compose.yml` file:

1. Remove the DuckDNS service block:
   ```yaml
   # Remove this entire block
   duckdns:
     image: linuxserver/duckdns
     # ...
   ```

2. Update the Vaultwarden environment variables:
   ```yaml
   vaultwarden:
     environment:
       - DOMAIN=https://vault.yourdomain.com  # Replace with your domain
   ```

### 4. Deployment

Run the main deployment script:
```bash
./deploy-vault.sh
```

This will:
1. Generate admin token
2. Optionally, create SSL certificates
4. Optionally, configure Nginx
6. Launch Docker containers

<br>

## Accessing Your Vault

### Configuring Clients

#### Using the Web Vault:

1. Navigate to the URL of your Vaultwarden instance (i.e., `vault.cfargotunnel.com/login`, `vault.example.com/login`, etc.)

2. Use the initial admin credentials provided during setup to access the admin page

3. On the admin page, create your primary administrator account with a strong master password

#### Using the Desktop App:

1. Open Bitwarden desktop app

2. Expand the _"Accessing"_ dropdown menu below your login email

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05dac953-5f70-42ff-a83e-6fd63516d5d3)

3. Select _"Self-hosted"_ and enter your server URL (ex: ```https://vault.example.com```)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1fdc52d-3eb4-4459-8629-8d010f399406)

4. Use the initial admin credentials provided during setup

<br>

### Programmatic Access

#### Using the CLI:

The main deployment scripts will (optionally) build a _Docker container_ which will allow you to run the Bitwarden CLI -- while also pre-configuring it to use your custom domain.

If you would prefer a _host installation_ of the CLI, please review the [official documentation](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli) on how to do so based on your OS.

Reference the below for manual configuration of the CLI:
```bash
# Set server URL
bw config server https://vault.example.com

# Configure individual endpoints
bw config server \
  --api https://vault.example.com/api \
  --identity https://vault.example.com/identity \
  --web-vault https://vault.example.com \
  --icons https://vault.example.com/icons \
  --notifications https://vault.example.com/notifications
```

#### Using the Secrets Manager SDK:

Instructions for installing the Bitwarden Secrets Manager SDK based on your language of choice can be found [here](https://bitwarden.com/help/secrets-manager-sdk/).

Reference the below for configuring the SDK via _Python_:
```python
import logging
import os
from datetime import datetime, timezone

from bitwarden_sdk import BitwardenClient, DeviceType, client_settings_from_dict

# Create the BitwardenClient, which is used to interact with the SDK
client = BitwardenClient(
    client_settings_from_dict(
        {
            "apiUrl": os.getenv("API_URL"),
            "deviceType": DeviceType.SDK,
            "identityUrl": os.getenv("IDENTITY_URL"),
            "userAgent": "Python",
        }
    )
)

# Add some logging & set the org id
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
organization_id = os.getenv("ORGANIZATION_ID")

# Set the state file location
# Note: the path must exist, the file will be created & managed by the SDK
state_path = os.getenv("STATE_FILE")

# Attempt to authenticate with the Secrets Manager Access Token
client.auth().login_access_token(os.getenv("ACCESS_TOKEN"), state_path)
```

**NOTE**: It's best to avoid hard-coding secrets into your code—especially for a secrets manager. This leads us to a classic chicken-and-egg scenario. If you have experience with this, _vete con Dios_... Currently, I'm working on my personal workflow for this situation. My approach is to use an Ansible vault file to encrypt client settings (such as the access token, API URL, etc.) and rely on one of the following methods for decryption during automated workflows:

1. A temporarily decrypted vault password file

2. Logging into the Bitwarden CLI and programmatically pulling the vault password via a secure note (I know; a bit roundabout)

## Cloudflare Origin CA Certificate

If you would like to register your SSL certificate with Cloudflare (or another certificate authority) and obtain an **Origin CA certificate**, you will first need to generate a certificate signing request (CSR). Use the command below (replace with your private key name, if you brought your own):
```bash
openssl req -new -key private.key -out request.csr -config config/nginx/openssl.cnf
```

After you have your CSR, use it to obtain the Origin CA certificate by following the [official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/). Once you have registered your SSL certificate with Cloudflare and configured your setup to use them, you can discard the self-signed certificate, `certificate.crt`, **IF** it is no longer being used in your deployment...

## Security Considerations

- Always use strong passwords
- Keep your system updated
- Regularly backup the `/opt/bitwarden` directory
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Use 2FA where possible

<br>

## Maintenance

### Backup

Backup the `/opt/bitwarden` directory regularly:
```bash
tar -czf backup.tar.gz /opt/bitwarden
```

### Updates

To update Vaultwarden:
```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

<br>

## Troubleshooting

1. Check container logs:
```bash
docker logs k-room
docker logs tk-room
```

2. Verify Nginx configuration:
```bash
nginx -t
```

3. Check Cloudflare tunnel status:
```bash
docker logs tk-room
```
