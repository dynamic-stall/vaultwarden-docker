# Vaultwarden Deployment with Cloudflare Tunnel

**BLUF**: This repository contains scripts and configurations for deploying a self-hosted Vaultwarden instance with Cloudflare Tunnel integration, Nginx reverse proxy, and Docker Compose.

[Vaultwarden](https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/server) is an alternative implementation of the **Bitwarden** server API written in Rust and compatible with [upstream Bitwarden clients⁠](https://bitwarden.com/download/).

If you have a registered domain, you can customize your Bitwarden experience further by changing the server URLs (instructions provided further down).

Nginx and SSL setup are optional, but recommended. You can still deploy this with just the Cloudflare tunnel encryption, but Cloudflare can still see the source and destinations of your vault setup. This deployment strategy leverages the point-to-point encryption of Cloudflare via Tunnels along with enhance security and privacy by terminating the tunnel at Nginx set up as a reverse proxy.

Bitwarden/Vaultwarden is capable of managing both [passwords](https://bitwarden.com/help/password-manager-overview/) (via web app, desktop app, browser extension, mobile app, or CLI) as well as [secrets](https://bitwarden.com/help/secrets-manager-overview/) (via web app, CLI, or SDK).

<br>

## Prerequisites

- Linux server (_pref._ RHEL/CentOS/Fedora/Rocky; scripts use `dnf` package manager)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed
- [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) with a registered domain
- Basic understanding of networking and Docker concepts

<br>

## Components

1. **Docker Compose Setup**: Deploys Vaultwarden and Cloudflare Tunnel containers
2. **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Handles SSL termination and request forwarding
3. **Cloudflare Tunnel**: Provides secure access without exposing ports
4. **Admin Token Generation**: Securely creates admin dashboard access

<br>

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Initial Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dynamic-stall/vaultwarden-docker
cd vaultwarden-docker
```

2. Create `.env` file with required variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required environment variables:
- `ADMIN_TOKEN`: Generated by `admin-token-create.sh`
- `BW_DOMAIN`: Your domain (e.g., vault.example.com)
- `BW_PORT`: Local port for Vaultwarden (default: 8443)
- `BW_IP`: Container IP address
- `CF_TOKEN`: Cloudflare Tunnel token
- `CF_IP`: Cloudflare container IP address
- `DOCKER_NET`: Docker network name
- `SMTP_*`: Email configuration variables

### 2. Cloudflare Tunnel Setup

1. Log into [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) dashboard
2. Navigate to **Access** → **Tunnels**
3. Create new tunnel:
   - Click _"Create a tunnel"_
   - Name your tunnel
   - Copy the token for `CF_TOKEN` in `.env`
4. Configure public hostname:
   - **Type**: HTTP
   - **URL**: http://localhost:8443
   - **Domain**: Your chosen subdomain (e.g., vault.example.com)

### 3. Deployment

Run the main deployment script:
```bash
./deploy-vault.sh
```

This will:
1. Generate admin token
2. Optionally, create SSL certificates
4. Optionally, configure Nginx
5. Configure custom Docker network (predefined to use _172.31.20.0/26_; you can modify this via `./scripts/docker-custom-net.sh`)
6. Launch Docker containers

## Configuring Clients

### Installing Bitwarden CLI

Instructions for installing the Bitwarden CLI based on your OS/environment can be found [here](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/).

### Installing the Secrets Manager SDK

Instructions for installing the Bitwarden Secrets Manager SDK based on your language of choice can be found [here](https://bitwarden.com/help/secrets-manager-sdk/).

### Configuring Server URLs

#### Using the Web Vault:

1. Log out of your vault if currently logged in

2. On the login page, click "Settings" in the top right

3. Enter your server URL (ex: ```https://your-domain.example.com```)

4. Click _"Save"_ and proceed with login

#### Using the Desktop App:

1. Open Bitwarden desktop app

2. Expand the _"Accessing"_ dropdown menu below your login email

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05dac953-5f70-42ff-a83e-6fd63516d5d3)

4. Select _"Self-hosted"_ and enter your server URL (ex: ```https://your-domain.example.com```)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1fdc52d-3eb4-4459-8629-8d010f399406)

6. Continue logging in with the email and password set during configuration (NOT your master password, which is used to access the admin login page at ```https://your-domain.example.com/admin```)

#### Using the CLI:

Run the provided configuration script:
```bash
./scripts/configure-bw-cli.sh
```

Or manually configure:
```bash
# Set server URL
bw config server https://your-domain.example.com

# Configure individual endpoints
bw config server \
  --api https://your-domain.example.com/api \
  --identity https://your-domain.example.com/identity \
  --web-vault https://your-domain.example.com \
  --icons https://your-domain.example.com/icons \
  --notifications https://your-domain.example.com/notifications
```

#### Using the Secrets Manager SDK (Python):
```python
import logging
import os
from datetime import datetime, timezone

from bitwarden_sdk import BitwardenClient, DeviceType, client_settings_from_dict

# Create the BitwardenClient, which is used to interact with the SDK
client = BitwardenClient(
    client_settings_from_dict(
        {
            "apiUrl": os.getenv("API_URL", "http://localhost:4000"),
            "deviceType": DeviceType.SDK,
            "identityUrl": os.getenv("IDENTITY_URL", "http://localhost:33656"),
            "userAgent": "Python",
        }
    )
)

# Add some logging & set the org id
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
organization_id = os.getenv("ORGANIZATION_ID")

# Set the state file location
# Note: the path must exist, the file will be created & managed by the sdk
state_path = os.getenv("STATE_FILE")

# Attempt to authenticate with the Secrets Manager Access Token
client.auth().login_access_token(os.getenv("ACCESS_TOKEN"), state_path)
```

**NOTE:** It's best to avoid hard-coding secrets into your code -- especially for a secrets manager. This does, however, bring us to a classic chicken-or-egg scenario. If you have experience with this, _vete con Dios_... I'm currently hammering out my personal workflow for this scenario, which is to use an Ansible vault file to encrypt client settings (access token, API URL, etc.) and rely on either (A) a temporarily decrypted vault password file or (B) logging into the Bitwarden CLI and programmatically pulling the vault password via secure note (I know; hilariously roundabout) to decrypt the vault during automated workflows... I'm 100% open to suggestions on this process!

## Security Considerations

- Always use strong passwords
- Keep your system updated
- Regularly backup the `/opt/bitwarden` directory
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Use 2FA where possible

<br>

## Maintenance

### Backup

Backup the `/opt/bitwarden` directory regularly:
```bash
tar -czf backup.tar.gz /opt/bitwarden
```

### Updates

To update Vaultwarden:
```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

<br>

## Troubleshooting

1. Check container logs:
```bash
docker logs k-room
docker logs tk-room
```

2. Verify Nginx configuration:
```bash
nginx -t
```

3. Check Cloudflare tunnel status:
```bash
docker logs tk-room
```
